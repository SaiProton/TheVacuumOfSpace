# V.A.C.M.
***VACUUM ANOMALY CLEANING MACHINE***

A series of robots made to remove dangerous material using its built-in anomalous hyper-vacuum creation engine.

*Something is wrong with this one, however.*

Instead of generating a hyper-strong vacuum, it was prone to creating black holes due to the unusual over-voltage of its engine.

Before long, the managers of the *Extradimensional Wave Harnessing Plant* left it in the repair shop.

**VACM** wakes up approximately 50 years later; it seems that everyone is gone.
